## HTML Template Files Variables ##

Each of the HTML template files can be cutomized as needed per organziational 
requirements and supports the varibles as defined below. The freetaxii.conf file 
allows template files to be defined globally and also redefined at a speicific 
instance. For example, one can define an HTML template for all of the API roots
that are found on the server and can also override that template for a specific 
API root. This would allow each API root to have its own template and branding.
